  Welcome to Neo4j

With a native graph database at the core, Neo4j stores and manages data
in a natural, connected state. The graph database takes a property graph
approach, which is beneficial for both traversal performance and
operations runtime.

neo4j architecture diagram
Figure 1. Overview of the Neo4j ecosystem

Neo4j started as a graph database and has evolved into a rich ecosystem
with numerous tools, applications, and libraries. This ecosystem allows
you to seamlessly integrate graph technologies with your working
environment.

To explore more information about each component, visit the Neo4j
Download center <https://neo4j.com/deployment-center/>.
For instructions on installing and deploying Neo4j, refer to the Neo4j
documentation <https://neo4j.com/docs/getting-started/get-started-with-
neo4j/#neo4j-docs>.
*The latest version of Neo4j is 5.17.*


    <#graph-database>Neo4j Graph Database

Neo4j Graph Database <https://neo4j.com/product/neo4j-graph-database/?
ref=product/> is the core product, a native graph database that is built
to store and retrieve connected data.
Two editions <https://neo4j.com/licensing/>, a Community Edition and an
Enterprise Edition, are available.
There are various ways to get started with Neo4j:

  *

    by installing on-premises <https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/
    current/installation/>

  *

    by deploying on the cloud platform <https://neo4j.com/docs/
    operations-manual/current/cloud-deployments/> of your choice

  *

    by using Neo4j Aura <https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/?ref=developer-guides>

You can find all necessary documentation on how to install and maintain
Neo4j in the Operations manual <https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-
manual/current/>.


    <#neo4j-aura>Neo4j Aura

AuraDB and AuraDS are fully managed cloud service offerings.

Neo4j AuraDB <https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/?ref=developer-guides> is a
graph database as a service. For more information, see the official
documentation <https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/current/>.

To interact with an Aura instance, use Neo4j Workspace <https://
neo4j.com/product/workspace/> — a low-code UI-based tool that helps you
to design a data model, preview the model, import the data, and explore
and query the database.

*Neo4j AuraDS* makes it easy to run graph algorithms on Neo4j by
integrating two main components:

  *

    *Neo4j Database*, where graph data are loaded and stored, and
    Cypher^® queries and all database operations (for example user
    management, query termination, etc.) are executed.

  *

    *Graph Data Science*, a software component installed in the Neo4j
    Database, which main purpose is to run graph algorithms on in-memory
    projections of Neo4j Database.

Neo4j AuraDS is available on GCP. See pricing <https://neo4j.com/
pricing/#graph-data-science> page for details. You can find more details
in the official documentation <https://neo4j.com/docs/aura/aurads/> for
AuraDS.


    <#neo4j-gds>Neo4j Graph Data Science

Neo4j Graph Data Science <https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science/?
ref=product> (GDS) gives you access to more than 65 graph algorithms,
which can be executed with Neo4j and optimized for enterprise workloads
and pipelines. GDS helps you to get insights from big data in order to
answer critical questions and improve predictions. GDS is the connected
data analysis platform that unifies the ML surface and graph database
into a single workspace.

See documentation <https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/>
for the library for more details.


    <#neo4j-tools>Neo4j Tools
